# Android-Native-News

This repository houses an News App that I developed while following the tutorial series by Philipp Lackner. The tutorial covered essential topics such as MVVM architecture, Retrofit, Coroutines, Navigation Components, and importantly, integrating a Room database to save and manage favorite articles. The app utilizes the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) for fetching news articles.

The [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQkwcJG4YTCRF8XiCRESq1IFFW8COlxYJ) by [Philipp Lackner](https://github.com/philipplackner) can be found on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilippLackner). The series covers various topics related to modern Android app development, including:

- MVVM architecture
- Consuming RESTful APIs using Retrofit
- Local data storage using Room
- Asynchronous programming with Coroutines
- In-app navigation using Navigation Components

The tutorial series was incredibly helpful in understanding these important concepts and how they come together to create a robust and well-structured Android application.
